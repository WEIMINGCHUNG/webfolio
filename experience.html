				<p><small>		
					From July 2023, I worked as a postdoctoral research scholar at National Taiwan University's <a href="https://iox.ntu.edu.tw/" target="_blank">IoX Center</a>. The center facilitates research collaborations between NTU and the industry partner, Cathay Life Insurance Company. My primary responsibility is to support the center's cross-disciplinary teams in envisioning their future research in the field of FinTech (financial technology). Through several creative and iterative design workshops, I assist the project researchers in exploring scenarios and envisioning how AI and big data can support these scenarios.

		<h2>Leadership Experience</h2>	
        <ul>
			<li>2015, Steering Committee, the 6th Student-organized Workshop on Human-Computer Interaction, OpenHCI 2015: 喚體 Haunting Artifact, Taiwan</li>

			
			<li>2014, Steering Committee, the 5th Student-organized Workshop on Human-Computer Interaction, OpenHCI 2014: 延滯因子 Lagontology, Taiwan</li>
			
			<li>2013, Sponsorship Committee, the 4th Student-organized Workshop on Human-Computer Interaction, OpenHCI 2013: 快步慢遊, Taiwan</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p><small>
From 2012 to 2017, I volunteered to co-organize <a href="https://www.facebook.com/openhci/" target="_blank">OpenHCI</a>, a multidisciplinary design workshop focused on human-computer interaction (HCI). The workshop involved master and Ph.D. students from different disciplines in universities across Taiwan. The goal of OpenHCI was to explore new or alternative interaction possibilities through prototyping artifacts. Participants were recruited from various disciplines, including interaction design, art, design, electronic engineering, computer science, music, and social science. In 2014 and 2015, I served as the design mentor for OpenHCI, coaching and supporting students in needfinding for their interaction design projects. In 2013, I served on the Sponsorship Committee and was responsible for public relations and sponsorship programs.

		<h2>Lecture and Talk</h2>	
        <ul>
			<li>2021-present, Adjunct Lecturer in lecture, “Case study: Design for futures,” Dept. of Product Design, Ming Chuan University, Taiwan</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p><small>
					Beyond human-centered design, which focuses on user experiences in the present, this course motivates possible technology futures that do not yet exist. Students will craft speculations by presenting plausible future proposals with emerging technologies, cultural issues, or ecological changes. Designed artifacts will also be used to embrace diverse perspectives and ideologies and enable critical debates, technological imaginations, and further reflections.
				</p></small>
			</blockquote>
			
			<li>2017-present, Adjunct Lecturer in lecture, “Experience-centered design,” Dept. of Product Design, Ming Chuan University, Taiwan</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p><small>
					The objective of this course is to help product designers gain a better understanding of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Students will need to gather insights from field observations in daily life to identify design opportunities. Based on that, they will be encouraged to prototype tangible or graphical user interfaces for the target audience to enhance people’s lived experiences.
				</p></small>
			</blockquote>
			
			<li>2019.04, Presentation, “Once Upon a Future,” Intel Face-to-Face meeting, Santa Clara, CA</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p><small>
					I worked as a research assistant at National Taiwan University's IoX Center from May 2016 to December 2020. In April 2019, I represented the Natural and Seamless Interaction team of the center at the 2019 Face-to-Face Meeting. I presented how we facilitated technology imaginations and promoted project synergies with our designerly tools over four years.
