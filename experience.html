			<blockquote>
				<p><small>
					Beyond human-centered design that focuses on user experiences, this course motivates possible technology futures which are yet to exist. Students have to craft speculations by presenting plausible future proposals with emerging technologies, cultural issues, or ecological changes. Designed artifacts are also used to embrace diverse perspectives and ideology and enable critical debates, technological imaginations, and further reflections.
